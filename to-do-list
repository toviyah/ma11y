This is a list of features to be included in ma11y accessible mail client.
1.  Include an option to read messages in an existing window
	a. What kind of edit program for editing messagess should we use?
2.  I would like to see menu driven with key commands for basic functions and optional key-commands next to the menu name.
3.  let's have support for multiple accounts on same servers and simple way to switch to other profile for accounts on other servers.
4.  And of course we should have imap or pop3 with options for the varius common secure or insecure protocol options.
5.  I would consider these other things:
	a. Do we want automatic mail sorting and spamm filter?
	b. Consider whether magnification is built-in.
c. Menubar should be a toggle option with the standard f-10 to access the menus.
